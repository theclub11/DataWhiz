# **DataWhiz: Pakistan Mobile/CNIC OSINT Tool**

**DataWhiz** is a Python-based application designed to retrieve information related to Pakistani mobile numbers and CNICs (Computerized National Identity Cards). It was developed in response to community requests for a tool focused on this region. The application offers both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), serving as an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) utility for research and verification purposes.

## Demo (POC)

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eba49e0f-ddf1-4f35-a39d-9e9091f2aebb" controls width="100%"></video>

> **Note:** This is a short proof-of-concept demonstrating both the CLI and GUI modes of DataWhiz.

## **Features**

* **Dual Interface**: Provides both an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* **Mobile Number Lookup**: Fetches details associated with Pakistani mobile numbers.
* **CNIC Lookup**: Retrieves information linked to Pakistani CNICs.
* **Results Saving**: Allows users to save lookup results to a text file.
* **Clipboard Integration (GUI)**: Enables quick copying of results to the clipboard.

## **Prerequisites**

> **For Precompiled Binaries:**

* Linux system with **GLIBC 2.38 or higher**. For issues related to missing GLIBC versions, see the [GLIBC Compatibility Guide](./GLIBC.md).

> **For Running from Source:**

* Python 3.x (3.10+ recommended)
* `requests` (For making internal data requests)
* `beautifulsoup4` (For data parsing)
* `fake_useragent` (For generating random user agents)
* `customtkinter` (GUI only)
* `Pillow` (Dependency of customtkinter, GUI only)
* `colorama` (Colored terminal output)
* `prompt_toolkit` (CLI only)

For **GUI version only** (Source and Binary), ensure `python3-tk` and `libxcb1` are installed [see GUI Prerequisites](#gui-prerequisites).

## **Installation**

### Option 1: Use Precompiled Binaries (No Setup Required)

Download the latest precompiled executables for CLI and GUI from the [Releases](https://github.com/AnonKryptiQuz/DataWhiz/releases) page.

> **Note:** The API endpoint is embedded in the precompiled binaries, so you don‚Äôt need to manually set it. This bypasses the API restrictions present in the source code version.

### Option 2: Run from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnonKryptiQuz/DataWhiz.git
   cd DataWhiz
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure that `requirements.txt` contains the following:

   ```text
   requests
   beautifulsoup4
   fake_useragent
   customtkinter
   Pillow
   colorama
   prompt_toolkit
   ```

### CLI Prerequisites

1. **For Precompiled CLI Binary**
   No additional setup is required. The CLI binary is fully standalone and includes all necessary dependencies, including Python.

2. **For Running CLI from Source**
   Ensure Python packages are installed. You can install them via:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> These packages are required for CLI interaction, input handling, and colorized output.

### GUI Prerequisites
   
1. **Install Required System Packages (GUI Only)**

   If you plan to use the **GUI version** (Source or Binary), install the required system-level dependencies:

   #### **Debian / Ubuntu / Kali / Linux Mint**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-tk libxcb1
   ```

   #### **Arch / Manjaro**

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S tk libxcb
   ```

   #### **Fedora**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y python3-tkinter libxcb
   ```

   #### **openSUSE**

   ```bash
   sudo zypper install -y python3-tk libxcb1
   ```

   #### **Pop!\_OS**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-tk libxcb1
   ```

> These packages are required for graphical display support. Without them, the GUI binary or source version may fail to launch with errors related to `tkinter` or `libxcb`.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è API Access Notice**

```python
# üîê API endpoint removed to prevent abuse or scraping.
# üì¨ Reach out on X (formerly Twitter): @AnonKryptiQuz (https://x.com/AnonKryptiQuz) for access or download the precompiled binary to bypass API restrictions.

_cr_u = API_ENDPOINT = "REDACTED_FOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE_CONTACT_X_@AnonKryptiQuz"
```

> In order for the tool to function correctly when running the source code version, you must **manually replace the `_cr_u` variable above with the actual API URL**.
> To obtain it, please contact [@AnonKryptiQuz](https://x.com/AnonKryptiQuz).
> Alternatively, you may [download the precompiled PyInstaller binary](https://github.com/AnonKryptiQuz/DataWhiz/releases), which includes the API and bypasses this restriction.

## **Build Your Own Precompiled Binary**

To create your own standalone executable (binary) for **CLI** or **GUI**, follow these steps:

1. **Create the necessary hook for `fake_useragent`:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p hooks
   echo "from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_data_files
   datas = collect_data_files('fake_useragent')" > hooks/hook-fake_useragent.py
   ```

2. **Compile the CLI version:**

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --additional-hooks-dir=hooks DataWhiz_CLI_NEW.py
   ```

3. **Compile the GUI version:**

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --additional-hooks-dir=hooks DataWhiz_GUI_NEW.py
   ```

This will generate standalone executables for both CLI and GUI versions that include all necessary dependencies.

## **Usage**

DataWhiz provides two modes of operation: a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The tool will automatically check and install necessary dependencies when launched.

### **CLI Usage**

1. **Run the CLI version (source code):**

   ```bash
   python DataWhiz_CLI.py
   ```

   **Or run the precompiled binary (no setup required):**

   ```bash
   ./DataWhiz_CLI
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**

   * Enter a valid Pakistani mobile number (e.g., `03xxxxxxxxx` or `+923xxxxxxxxx`) or a CNIC number (e.g., `xxxxxxxxxxxxx`).
   * The results will be displayed directly in the terminal.
   * You will be prompted to save the results to a text file.

### **GUI Usage**

1. **Run the GUI version (source code):**

   ```bash
   python DataWhiz_GUI.py
   ```

   **Or run the precompiled binary (no setup required):**

   ```bash
   ./DataWhiz_GUI
   ```

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions:**

   * You'll briefly see a launch animation in your terminal before the GUI window opens.
   * On the initial screen, select either "Mobile Number Lookup" or "CNIC Lookup".
   * Enter the mobile number or CNIC into the input field.
   * Click the "Search" button to retrieve information.
   * Results will be displayed in the text box. You can then use the "Save Results" or "Copy All" buttons.
   * Use the "Clear" button to clear the input and output fields.
   * You can go back to the mode selection screen using the "Back" button.
